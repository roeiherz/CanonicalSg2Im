A typical image in our SKU-110K, showing densely packed objects. (a) Detection results for the state-of-the-art RetinaNet[2], showing incorrect and overlapping detections, especially for the dark objects at the bottom which are harder to separate. (b) Our results showing far fewer misdetections and better fitting bounding boxes. (c) Zoomed-in views for RetinaNet[2] and (d) our method.


## Notes

**Please note that the main part of the code has been released, though we are still testing it to fix possible glitches. Thank you.**

This implementation is built on top of https://github.com/google/sg2im.
